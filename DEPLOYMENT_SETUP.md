# 🚀 Final Deployment Setup

## Your Deployed Applications

- **Frontend**: https://vehicle-parking-systems.netlify.app/
- **Backend**: https://vehicle-parking-system-production.up.railway.app

## 🔧 Required Configuration Steps

### 1. Railway Backend Configuration

Go to your Railway project dashboard and set these environment variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-now
SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=your-security-salt-change-this-now
FRONTEND_URL=https://vehicle-parking-systems.netlify.app
FLASK_ENV=production
```

**How to set Railway environment variables:**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project: `vehicle-parking-system-production`
3. Click on "Variables" tab
4. Add each variable above

### 2. Netlify Frontend Configuration

Go to your Netlify site dashboard and set this environment variable:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://vehicle-parking-system-production.up.railway.app
```

**How to set Netlify environment variables:**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/vehicle-parking-systems/settings
2. Click "Environment variables" in the sidebar
3. Add the variable above
4. Redeploy your site

### 3. Test the Connection

After setting the environment variables:

1. **Redeploy both applications**:
   - Railway: Will auto-redeploy when you save environment variables
   - Netlify: Go to Deploys → Trigger deploy

2. **Test the backend health**:
   - Visit: https://vehicle-parking-system-production.up.railway.app/health
   - Should return: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

3. **Test the frontend**:
   - Visit: https://vehicle-parking-systems.netlify.app/
   - Try logging in with: `admin@parking.com` / `admin`

## 🎯 Demo Credentials

- **Admin Login**: 
  - Email: `admin@parking.com`
  - Password: `admin`

- **User Registration**: 
  - Create a new account to test user features

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you see CORS errors:
1. Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly in Railway
2. Make sure there's no trailing slash in the URL

### If API calls fail:
1. Check `VITE_API_URL` is set in Netlify
2. Verify Railway backend is running by visiting `/health`

### If login doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify both apps are using HTTPS (not HTTP)
